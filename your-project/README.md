## Project Description
I chose to build Guess The Number Game because I understood the principle straightaway. 
I wanted to create a project that I believed I was able to finish myself. 

## Rules
1. Computer chooses a random number up to 100.
2. Human gets 8 tries to guess the number.
3. If number is wrong, computer says "higher" or "lower". If number is right, computer says "you won". 

## Workflow
1. Planning in Trello
2. Research (short phase)
3. Coding, testing, error handling
4. Adding new features
5. Preparing the presentation
6. Updating the repository

## Organization
I used Trello only.

My repository has files README and Jupyter Notebook with code in "your-project" folder, README and gitignore files in the root.
