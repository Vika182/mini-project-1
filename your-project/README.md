## Project Description
I chose to build Guess The Number Game because I understood the principle straightaway. I wanted to create a project that I believe I am able to finish myself. 

## Rules
1. Computer chooses a random number up to 100.
2. Human gets 8 tries to guess the number.
3. If number is wrong, computer says "higher" or "lower". If number is right, computer says "you won". 

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and trello/kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
